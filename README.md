# 1. Introduction

"It takes a village"
Defi peaked at 153.5B USD locked on May 10, 2021 and has generally kept above 100B USD for the rest of the year.
Ethereum had 114B USD locked, 74.5% of total TVL in the entire market.
BSC had 29B USD locked, 18.9% of total TVL in the entire market.

Today, on 15th July, make up of the Defi market has changed drastically. TVL is now at 108B USD.
Ethereum has about 82.7B USD locked (-29%) but making up 75.9% of the market
BSC has 13.7B USD locked (-53%) and only makes up 12.6%.

This paper focuses on growing a sustainable ecosystem for Sovryn in order to increase its TVL with the potential for explosive growth from its current TVL of 53M on 15th July.

# 2. Contribution

I analyse Sovryn's ecosystem in terms of its infrastructure, potential user base, features, and educational efforts. Each aspect of the ecosystem yields potential insights that could supercharge Sovryn's TVA efforts. Sovryn has a clear unique value proposition that could help supercharge its TVL in the next year or so. In short, standardised interfaces, ease of lending, and focus on institutional funds through their relative comfort with Bitcoin would be the strategy for Sovryn's ecosystem growth.

# 3. Analysis of Sovryn's ecosystem

This chapter provides a quick overview of Sovryn's ecosystem to serve as a basis for further analysis and recommendations.

## A. Infrastructure
Built on RSK network and using EVM-compatible smart contracts. Ethereum monthly developer numbers are at its highest in a few years at ~2400 and Defi developers make up 900 of them. (Source: [Electric Capital developer report](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2020-9417165c6444))

However, when you look at the number of dapps currently being built, each team is actually somewhat small. There's 181 Dapps listed on defillama which means the average team has just around 5 developers.

Diving deeper into each Dapp's Github,
1. Curve - 11 developers
2. Uniswap - 8 developers
3. Aave - 17 dvelopers

These 3 Dapps already make up 4% of all active developers assuming they work on each Dapp exclusively.

> ***Insight: It is challenging to build features for any Dapp, not just Sovryn due to the scarcity of developers.***

## B. User base
Early adopters that have experience working with decentralised applications. These early adopters will have come from existing decentralised applications. This means the potential use base is somewhat small. 
At its peak, there are [163M active Ethereum addresses](https://etherscan.io/chart/address)

At its peak, there are [83M active BSC addresses](https://www.bscscan.com/chart/address)
![](https://i.imgur.com/mMrifg3.png)

However, when you look at daily active users, that number drops about half.
[Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/chart/active-address): peak at ~580k, currently ~470k
![](https://i.imgur.com/BT2ierW.png)

[BSC](https://www.bscscan.com/chart/active-address): peak ~1.2M, currently ~500k
![](https://i.imgur.com/NuvuxHH.png)

> ***Insight: There are potentially many more users out there, the chance that each user has 300 Ethereum addresses or 80 BSC addresses are very low.***

## C. Sovryn's current features

Sovryn currently has 5 starting features:
1. Liquidity Mining
2. Margin Trading
3. Swaps
4. Market Making
5. Lending

According to Defi pulse with 113 Dapps, these are the top applications that currently exist.
* Lending: 30 Dapps
* Assets: 29 Dapps
* DEXes: 25 Dapps
* Derivatives: 23 Dapps
* Payments: 6 Dapps

The TVL is extremely concentrated on just the top 10 Dapps (58.27B TVL, 70% of total TVL on ETH). Analysing these DApps provide an interesting result . 
(5) Lending: Aave, InstaDapp, Compound, Maker, Liquity 
(3) DEXes: Curve, Uniswap, Sushiswap
(2) Assets: Convex finance, yearn.finance

As a note, Defipulse's Lending Dapps provide liquidity and stablecoins through collaterising then lending assets while Asset Dapps are for users to store assets and do not act as assets.

Sovryn seems to have covered most of the popular Dapps in terms of features from a macro perspective. However, each Lending Dapp has its own unique value proposition.

* [Aave](https://aave.com/): Aave is an open source and non-custodial liquidity protocol for **earning interest on deposits and borrowing assets**.
* [InstaDapp](https://instadapp.io/): **Create powerful use cases for your users** with just javascript code, without worrying about smart contracts & expensive audits.
* [Compound](https://compound.finance/): Compound is an algorithmic, autonomous **interest rate protocol** built for developers, to unlock a universe of open financial applications.
* [Maker](https://makerdao.com/en/): Dai is a **stable, decentralized currency** that does not discriminate. Any individual or business can realize the advantages of digital money. More specifically, to collateraise assets into a stablecoin.
* [Liquity](https://www.liquity.org/): Liquity is an **interest-free, collateralized borrowing protocol and stablecoin with novel batched and instant liquidations**. It is governance-free, completely immutable, and has a minimum collateral ratio of 110%.

Each of these Dapps are the backbone of the Defi ecosystem, providing stablecoins for trading and storing value, tools to build new types of assets and use cases, and the ability to borrow at low interest rates.

> ***Insight: In order to grow a Defi ecosystem, the ability to lend is key to providing liquidity to the ecosystem which powers applications. Users of these applications will then need a stablecoin in order to transact between products.***

## D. Education: [Blockchain Dojo](https://wiki.sovryn.app/en/library/education/blockchain-dojo-index)

Sovryn's education effort is currently on basic blockchain knowledge. However, education is key to adoption. Taking a leaf from Rabbithole's quests, educating and upskilling users can also lead to greater adoption.

Here's a small case study on how [Pooltogether gained 1,000 users](https://twitter.com/dr_ethereum/status/1412191433738444801/photo/1).
![](https://i.imgur.com/7Ff9es6.png)

> ***Insight: Sovryn has great UI! However, most people are still unfamiliar with what Defi can do for them. Approaching it logically, it makes no sense to simply leave one's earnings in a bank accruing sub 1% interest rates. However, the familiarity and service-orientedness of banks incentiveses users to be lazy. Creating self-serve onboarding activities to Sovryn's products will greatly improve adoption***

# 4. Defi as an ecosystem

(Source: [Decentralized Finance Policy-maker toolkit by World Economic Forum](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_DeFi_Policy_Maker_Toolkit_2021.pdf))

The diagram above describes the current state of the ecosystem. Due to the composability of smart contracts, layers upon layers of applications can build on each other. Advanced products carry out aggregation of applications in order to spread out risk, mimicking TradFi's exchange traded funds.

In order to massively expand the TVL of Sovryn, each application should be built out efficiently and designed for integration between applications. Thus, standard cross-app interfaces through Sovryn Improvement Proposals (SIPs) should be established first rather than encouraging the developer base to build arbitrarily.

Following Sovryn's mission of being a Finanical OS, these standard interfaces will allow for easier audits of smart contracts (with solidity smart contracts notoriously hackable) and integration between Dapps. Finance also thrives on available data. Simpler integrations and an event bus will allow for new Dapps and data providers which would provide Sovryn an edge over other protocols too.

# 5. Key Recommendations: Sovryn's TVA initiative

"For more TVL, always"

Taking a bottom up approach, here's a potential ecosystem roadmap to guide the TVA initiative.

## A. The Sacred Interface

"But then, the all-knowing Time Keepers emerged, bringing peace by reorganizing the multiverse into a single timeline, the Sacred Timeline. Now the Time Keepers protect and preserve the proper flow of time for everyone and everything."

Much like how the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards created an explosion of activity on Ethereum, standard interfacts and event emission will grow the TVA initiative.

## B. Prune variants

As Sovryn is EVM compatible, the [EIP-1155 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) could be adopted for Sovryn's tokens so that all known forms of tokens can be enabled immediately. Furthermore, there are additional safeguards built into this standard so as to prevent hacks that have occurred previously on Ethereum.


## C. Preserve the Messageline (read: timeline)

Similar to the [EIP-1193 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) for Ethereum provider APIs and supported by an overall smart contract registry similar to [EIP-820 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-820) and a [proposed standard interface as a message bridge across layer 2s and protocols](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-standard-interface-for-arbitrary-message-bridges-between-chains-layers/6163) that even includes a [reference implementation](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-standard-interface-for-arbitrary-message-bridges-between-chains-layers/6163).
 
This will allow for less integration work between up and coming applications and features on Sovryn, improving the developer experience and potentially helping to convert more Ethereum developers to work on Sovryn.

## D. Stable assets
There won't be a need for many asset Dapps as long as a reliable yet flexible stablecoin can be introduced. Sovryn currently has digital assets and 4 stablecoins (xUSD,rUSDT, and DoC). 

Right now, we can adopt Maker's approach to collateralising assets and creating stablecoins for the ecosystem. Observing [Maker's Growth Core Unit's](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip39c2-sp4-growth-core-unit-gro-001/6715) mandate: the key channels we wish to expand are the (1) ability of borrowers to generate Dai, (2) the ability of users to buy and sell Dai, and (3) the ability of users to perform a useful activity with Dai.

The Core Unit is split by region as each region has its own use case for Dai. This targeted strategy can allow for localisation efforts to seek out different forms of collateral which are usually constrained by legal obligations.

## E. Data
Integration with [the Graph](https://thegraph.com/) would lead to subgraphs for on-chain data on Sovryn. This unified service is necessary for financial data and would prevent duplication of efforts across Dapps on Sovryn. This way, a dedicated indexing team could focus on ensuring users would have accurate data and developers would have reliable data to build frontends.

## F. Applications
Thereafter, judging by the growth in institutional interest in Bitcoin evident through Grayscale's trust and ARK, Sovryn bears a unique advantage over **all** other protocols. It's the only smart contract network that's up and running well on Bitcoin with working features. Taking a leaf from [88mph](https://88mph.app/), familiar financial products could be created from Bitcoin which would lead to institutional funds flowing into Sovryn. This would tap on a completely new user base run by professional money managers.

# Conclusion
Sovryn protocol is poised to become an amazing ecosystem for 3 key reasons.
1. Great User Interfaces
2. Based on Bitcoin
3. No legacy Apps

A curated approached such as the TVA Initiative could balance the dearth of developers with the need to build new features by focusing on the most important financial infrastructure that will build up Sovryn's vision of becoming a Finanical OS.
